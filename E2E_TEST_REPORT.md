# E2E Test Report

## Summary
Login E2E tests are failing due to client-side authentication flow issues. The browser tests are not successfully calling the new `/api/auth/login` and `/api/session/me` endpoints.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Updated CORS to use `CORS_ORIGIN` instead of hardcoded origins
- ✅ Updated session config to only set `domain` if `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` env var is provided
- ✅ Set cookies with `secure: true` and `sameSite: 'none'` for production

### 2. New Auth Endpoints
- ✅ Created `/api/auth/login` endpoint that sets session and returns 200
- ✅ Created `/api/session/me` endpoint that returns user info if authenticated
- ✅ Both endpoints support credentials

### 3. Client Login Flow
- ✅ Updated `client/src/auth/session.tsx` to:
  - POST to `/api/auth/login` with credentials
  - GET `/api/session/me` to verify session
  - Set user state on success
- ✅ Fixed `loginMutation` shim for compatibility with `AuthPageDev`
- ✅ Fixed dev account passwords from `Test1234!` to `password`

### 4. Playwright Tests
- ✅ Updated `tests/utils/auth.ts` to wait for `/api/session/me` response before asserting URL
- ✅ Updated test credentials from `Test1234!` to `password`

## Test Results

### Basic Smoke Tests
- ✅ Homepage loads without errors
- ✅ Login page loads
- ✅ Auth setup bootstrap works

### Login E2E Tests
- ❌ Login flow times out waiting for `/api/session/me` response
- ❌ The client is not calling the endpoints as expected
- ❌ Need to debug why the login form submission isn't triggering the API calls

## Artifacts
- Test screenshots: `test-results/e2e-smoke.login-Login-Flow-*/test-failed-1.png`
- Test videos: `test-results/e2e-smoke.login-Login-Flow-*/video.webm`
- Test traces: `test-results/e2e-smoke.login-Login-Flow-*/trace.zip`

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why `/api/session/me` isn't being called
2. Check browser console logs from test screenshots
3. Verify Vite proxy configuration
4. Consider simplifying the test to directly test API endpoints first
