- Update tests: Missing
- Delete tests: Missing

**Action Plan:**
1. Run existing session tests
2. Create update session tests
3. Create delete session tests
4. Test validations (dates, capacity, etc.)

**Expected Tests:**
- ✅ Create session (likely passing)

- ⏳ Delete session (need to create)
- ⏳ Validation rules
- ⏳ Date/time handling
- ⏳ Capacity limits

---

### Priority 3: Meal Plan & Fitness CRUD
**User Request:** "Focus on meal plan and fitness CRUD validation tests"

**Current Status:**
- No dedicated test files yet
- Page smoke tests passing

**Action Plan:**
1. Create `meal-plans.crud.spec.ts`
2. Create `fitness.crud.spec.ts`
3. Implement full CRUD tests
4. Add validation tests

**Expected Tests - Meal Plans:**
- Create meal plan
- Read/view meal plan
- Update meal plan
- Delete meal plan
- File upload (PDFs/images)
- Nutritional validation

**Expected Tests - Fitness:**
- Create fitness assessment
- View assessment history
- Update fitness records

## 🔍 Detailed Failure Analysis

### Announcements E2E (Deprioritized)
**Files:** `tests/announcements.e2e.spec.ts`

**Root Cause:**
- `CreateAnnouncementModal` component uses conditional rendering: `if (!open) return null`
- Modal state not being updated when button clicked
- Need to investigate state management in `DashboardAnnouncementsPage`

**Why Deprioritized:**
- Not in user's top 4 priorities
- Complex state debugging required
- Can revisit after priority features done

---

### Add Player DOB (Can Fix Later)
**Files:** `tests/e2e/add-player.dob.spec.ts`

**Root Cause:**
- `/dashboard/team` page not loading or rendering
- `Team Management` heading not visible within timeout

**Potential Fixes:**
- Increase navigation timeout
- Add loading state waits
- Check for auth/permission issues

**Priority:** Medium (not in top 4, but useful for team management)

---

### Auth Page Dev Accounts (Low Priority)
**Files:** `tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts`

**Root Cause:**
- `Development Accounts` UI section not showing
- May only show in development mode
- May need `VITE_ENABLE_DEV_LOGIN` UI check

**Potential Fixes:**
- Skip test in production
- Update UI to show dev accounts when feature flag enabled
- Remove test if not needed

**Priority:** Low (authentication works, this is just UI display)

## 📋 Recommended Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Assessment (30 minutes)
```bash
# Run payment tests
npx playwright test tests/*payment* tests/e2e/*payment* --reporter=list

# Run session tests
npx playwright test tests/sessions* tests/e2e/sessions* --reporter=list

# Run full suite (no max-failures)
npx playwright test --reporter=list
```

### Phase 2: Payment Flows (2-3 hours)
1. Fix any payment test failures
2. Verify Stripe test mode integration
3. Test full payment lifecycle
4. Achieve 80%+ payment test pass rate

### Phase 3: Session CRUD (2-3 hours)
1. Verify create tests pass
2. Implement update tests
3. Implement delete tests
4. Add comprehensive validations
5. Achieve 80%+ session test pass rate

### Phase 4: Meal Plans & Fitness (3-4 hours)
1. Create test files
2. Implement CRUD tests
3. Add validation tests
4. Achieve 60%+ pass rate for each

### Phase 5: Cleanup (1 hour)
1. Fix quick wins (auth page, debug tests)
2. Document remaining issues
3. Final pass rate assessment
