# E2E Test Progress on Render

## Current Status
- **20 passed** ✅
- **44 failed** ❌
- **1 skipped** ⏭️

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is **authentication persistence**. Tests are creating sessions via `/api/dev/login` and saving `storageState`, but:

1. **Session cookie not persisting across page navigations**
2. **Pages redirecting to `/auth` because session is not recognized**
3. **All "element not visible" errors are because pages show login instead of content**

## Evidence

```bash
# Dev login returns 200 OK with session
curl -c /tmp/c.txt -d '{"email":"admin@test.com"}' https://...com/api/dev/login
# {"ok":true,"user":{...}}

# But dashboard immediately redirects to /auth (302)
curl -b /tmp/c.txt https://...com/dashboard
# HTTP/2 302 Location: /auth
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix session persistence**: Ensure `requireAuth` middleware correctly reads session from PG store
2. **Verify cookie settings**: Check `sameSite`, `secure`, `path` are correct for Render
3. **Test session read**: Confirm `/api/session/me` or similar returns user after dev-login
4. **Update auth setup**: Make it wait longer after login to ensure session is fully written

## Deployment History

1. Initial: Memory store (sessions lost on deploy) ❌
2. Enabled PG store: Should persist, but session not being read correctly ❌
3. Need: Debug why requireAuth can't read the session
