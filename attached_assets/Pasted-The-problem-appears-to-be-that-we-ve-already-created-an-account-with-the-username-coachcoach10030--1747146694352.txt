The problem appears to be that we've already created an account with the username "coachcoach10030" and email "coachcoach10030@yahoo.com" during our testing, which is why we're seeing the conflicts. This is normal expected behavior for account registration systems.

Let's focus on the standardization issue with error responses. Now that I've fixed the success responses to follow the standard format, I need to make sure error responses also follow the standardized format. The current error responses during failed registrations are not using our standardized format with success: false.

Let's fix this issue by modifying how registration errors are returned:


Opened server/auth.ts
Let's find all error response instances in the registration process and standardize them:


Edited server/auth.ts
I see there's a duplicate import issue. Let's fix that and continue updating the error responses:


Opened server/auth.ts
Let's fix the duplicate import issue and then continue updating the error responses:


Edited server/auth.ts
Let's view the imports at the top of the file to ensure we get the createErrorResponse function imported properly:


Opened server/auth.ts
Great, now let's continue updating the error responses to use the standardized format:


Edited server/auth.ts
Let's look at the createErrorResponse function to ensure we're using it correctly:


Opened server/utils/api-response.ts
I see the issue - the createErrorResponse function expects message, code, status, and data in that order. Let's fix this in our implementation:


Edited server/auth.ts
Now let's also update the other error response for the email already in use case:


Edited server/auth.ts
Now let's find and update the username error case as well:


Executed grep -n "username.*already.*exists" server/auth.ts
I've been analyzing the errors with the standardization of our authentication endpoints.

Here's what I see:

✓ Standardized most authentication response formats
✓ Fixed /api/register endpoint to use proper format
✓ Successfully tested registration with standardized format
→ Fixing issue with error responses for the coachcoach10030@yahoo.com email
→ Need to update error responses to use createErrorResponse properly

I notice that we still need to standardize our error responses. I'm updating the error handling for email and username conflicts to use our createErrorResponse utility function with the proper parameters.

Let me continue making these fixes to ensure all authentication flows use our standardized format.

Let's look at the username check and fix that error response to use our standardized format as well:


Opened server/auth.ts
Let's fix the error response format for the username exists case:


Edited server/auth.ts
Let's test the error response for an existing username to see if our standardized format is working:


Executed curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"coachcoach10030", "email":"newcoach@yahoo.com", "password":"Cricket2025!", "fullName":"Test Coach", "role":"coach"}' | jq
It seems that our changes to server/auth.ts may not have been applied correctly. Let's verify that the server was restarted after our changes:


Restarted Start application
Now let's test the error response for an existing username again to see if our standardized format is working:


Executed curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"coachcoach10030", "email":"newcoach@yahoo.com", "password":"Cricket2025!", "fullName":"Test Coach", "role":"coach"}' | jq
Great! Now let's test the existing email error response:


Executed curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"newcoach2", "email":"coachcoach10030@yahoo.com", "password":"Cricket2025!", "fullName":"Test Coach", "role":"coach"}' | jq
Excellent! Both error responses are now correctly following our standardized format with:

{
  "success": false,
  "message": "...",
  "code": "...",
  "status": 400,
  "data": { ... },
  "timestamp": "..."
}
Let's also test the standardized registration endpoint to ensure it also follows the same format for error responses:


Executed curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/standard-register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"coachcoach10030", "email":"newcoach@yahoo.com", "password":"Cricket2025!", "fullName":"Test Coach", "role":"coach"}' | jq
Great! The standardized registration endpoint is also returning a properly formatted error response. Let's check the email conflict case as well:


Executed curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/standard-register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"newcoach5", "email":"coachcoach10030@yahoo.com", "password":"Cricket2025!", "fullName":"Test Coach", "role":"coach"}' | jq
Perfect! All our registration endpoints (both the original and standardized versions) are now correctly using the standardized response format for both success and error cases.

Let me summarize the changes I've made:

The agent has reported new progress:
✓ Fixed /api/register success response format with createSuccessResponse
✓ Updated error responses for username conflicts with createErrorResponse
✓ Updated error responses for email conflicts with createErrorResponse
✓ Verified all registration endpoints return standardized format
✓ Tested username and email conflict error responses
→ What other auth endpoints would you like me to standardize next?
