Step 1: Verify the Route Configuration

Ensure that your routing setup correctly maps the /parent path to the ParentDashboard component. In React Router v6, routes should be defined using the element prop instead of component. Here’s how your route should look:


import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import ParentDashboard from './pages/parent-dashboard';

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/parent" element={<ParentDashboard />} />
      {/* other routes */}
    </Routes>
  );
}

Make sure that:
	•	You’re using <Routes> instead of <Switch>, as Switch is deprecated in React Router v6.
	•	The element prop is used with a JSX element (<ParentDashboard />), not the component class or function itself.


 Step 2: Check the ParentDashboard Component

Ensure that the ParentDashboard component is correctly implemented and exported. A minimal example would be:

import React from 'react';

function ParentDashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Dashboard</h1>
      {/* other components */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentDashboard;

Verify that:
	•	The component is correctly imported in your routing configuration.
	•	There are no errors within the component that might prevent it from rendering.


Step 3: Confirm the Navigation

If you’re navigating to /parent programmatically or via a link, ensure that the navigation is set up correctly. For example, using the Link component:


import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to="/parent">Go to Parent Dashboard</Link>

Ensure that:
	•	The navigation path matches the route defined in your router.
	•	There are no typos or mismatches in the path names.

Step 4: Check for Placeholder Content

If you’re seeing a placeholder page, it’s possible that the ParentDashboard component currently contains placeholder content. Review the component to ensure it renders the intended UI elements.

tep 5: Inspect the Browser Console

Open your browser’s developer console to check for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with rendering the component. Common issues include:
	•	Import errors.
	•	Syntax errors within the component.
	•	Issues with nested components used within ParentDashboard.

Step 6: Verify the Build and Deployment

If you’re deploying your application, ensure that the build process includes the ParentDashboard component and that the deployment correctly serves the /parent route. Check your server configuration to ensure it supports client-side routing.
