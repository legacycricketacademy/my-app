The AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack web app stabilization for Legacy Cricket Academy. Key tasks involved environment setup (PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Node.js dependencies), fixing initial DB errors, and configuring server (CORS, sessions, ) and client-side (API calls with ) authentication. A user registration flow, mobile responsiveness, and type narrowing fixes were implemented. Comprehensive Playwright E2E tests and a CI workflow were created. Recurring  caused server crashes on Render preview, indicating persistent environment variable handling issues. GitHub token limitations also necessitated temporary removal of the CI workflow file for pushing. The work culminated in switching branches and preparing to resolve conflicts before further E2E testing.

The primary goal is to stabilize and enhance the Legacy Cricket Academy full-stack web app for youth cricket coaching. This includes achieving stable authentication and sessions, working dashboard routing, CRUD operations for players and schedules, Stripe payments integration, and ensuring all core flows pass Playwright E2E tests.

The user identified several critical problems:
1.  **Auth/Session Issues**: Broken authentication/session in production due to CORS/credentials/cookie misconfigurations.
2.  **Database Errors**: users table not found during dev login, indicating migration/seeding issues.
3.  **Routing Bugs**: Sidebar navigation leading to loading authentication flashes and redirects to the dashboard instead of the intended route.
4.  **UI Actions Failures**: Add New Player â†’ Save doing nothing, and Calendar dialog OK/Save being non-functional.
5.  **Type Errors**:  on some pages.
6.  **Flaky Playwright Tests**: Login path being unreliable.

The work so far has involved:
*   Setting up the repository, including PostgreSQL, Node.js dependencies, Drizzle migrations, and seeding test data.
*   Implementing a robust user registration flow with database persistence and email support (in dev mode).
*   Correcting server-side CORS, session, and cookie configurations, addressing  issues.
*   Adjusting client-side API calls to consistently use .
*   Improving mobile responsiveness of UI dialogs and adding defensive type checks.
*   Developing a comprehensive Playwright E2E test suite covering core functionalities and mobile viewports, along with an initial CI workflow.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on performing a comprehensive E2E stabilization pass for the Legacy Cricket Academy app. The context is a persistent  causing server crashes on the Render preview environment, despite previous attempts to fix it locally and push a hotfix. Additionally, Playwright E2E tests are failing due to authentication, session, and routing issues. The engineer has just been instructed to fix conflicts and push the latest code to the  branch. The current local branch  is ahead of its remote counterpart. The engineer's last action was to switch to  and prepare to resolve conflicts, specifically ensuring the  variable is correctly handled.
