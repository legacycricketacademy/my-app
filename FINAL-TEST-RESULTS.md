## 💡 Key Learnings

### 1. Render Cold Starts
- Free tier spins down after inactivity
- First request takes 10-60 seconds
- **Solution:** Retry logic + longer timeouts

### 2. Feature Flags for Safety
- Enable dangerous features only when needed
- Test in isolation
- Safe by default

### 3. Test-Driven Development
- data-testid on all elements
- Makes tests reliable
- Easy to debug

### 4. Mobile Testing
- Same tests, different viewport
- Playwright device emulation is excellent
- Catches responsive design issues

### 5. Incremental Progress
- Fix auth first (foundation)
- Then smoke tests (infrastructure)
- Then features (payments, sessions, etc.)
- Document everything
