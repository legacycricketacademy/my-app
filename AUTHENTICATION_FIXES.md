# Authentication System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Account Password Resets
- Fixed admin123 account with password "admin123"
- Fixed parentkite459 account with password "parentkite459"
- Created scripts to easily reset passwords in the future

### 2. Database Query Errors
- Fixed `getAllPayments` method by removing references to the non-existent `p.month` column 
- Fixed `getPendingPayments` method by removing references to the non-existent `is_over_under_payment` column
- Created diagnostic scripts to identify database schema mismatches

### 3. Authentication Flow
- Tested login functionality for both admin and parent accounts
- Confirmed passwords are correctly hashed and can be verified

## Future Improvements

### 1. Database Schema Sync
- Consider adding the missing columns to the database schema
- Keep `shared/schema.ts` in sync with actual database structure

### 2. Error Handling
- Improve error handling in authentication flows
- Add more detailed logging for failed login attempts

### 3. Automated Testing
- Implement comprehensive tests for authentication functionality
- Add integration tests for the login/logout process

## Diagnostic Tools

The following scripts were created to help diagnose and fix issues:

1. `db/fix-admin123-account.ts` - Resets admin123 account password
2. `db/reset-parentkite459-password.ts` - Resets parentkite459 account password
3. `db/test-login.ts` - Tests login functionality and password verification
4. `db/fix-payments-table-queries.ts` - Diagnoses issues with payment table queries
5. `db/fix-month-column-references.ts` - Checks for the existence of the month column

## Current DB Schema

The payments table contains the following columns:
- id
- player_id
- amount
- payment_type
- due_date
- paid_date
- status
- notes
- created_at
- updated_at
- academy_id
- session_duration
- expected_amount
- payment_method
- stripe_payment_intent_id
