# E2E Test Status - Render Deployment

**Last Updated:** After continuous fixing session  
**Environment:** `https://cricket-academy-app.onrender.com`

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ **27 passing** (range: 22-28 depending on Render state)
- ❌ **36 failing** (down from initial 46)
- 🔄 **1-3 flaky** (varies by run)
- ⏭️ **1 skipped**

**Pass Rate:** **~42%** (up from 25.8% initial)

---

## ✅ What's Working (Consistently Passing)

### Smoke Tests (Core Pages)
- ✅ Dashboard renders  
- ✅ Schedule page loads
- ✅ Fitness page loads
- ✅ Meal plans page loads
- ✅ **Announcements page loads**
- ✅ **Payments page loads**
- ✅ Sessions endpoint responds correctly

### Other Passing Tests
- ✅ Authentication setup (API-based dev login)
- ✅ Some navigation tests
- ✅ Some parent portal tests
- ✅ Session empty state tests

---

## ❌ What's Failing (Consistent Failures)

### High Priority (Simple Selector Fixes)
1. **Announcements E2E** (3 tests) - Button found but modal interactions failing
2. **Team Page** (1 test) - Page not rendering content
3. **Settings Page** (1 test) - Tabs not visible

### Medium Priority (UI/Modal Issues)
4. **Add Player DOB** (2 tests) - DOB picker not visible
5. **Schedule Modals** (2 tests) - Calendar not fully visible
6. **Sessions Create** (2 tests) - Session form elements missing
7. **UI Smoke Tests** (3 tests) - Modal open buttons not found

### Complex Flows (End-to-End)
8. **Navigation Tests** (3 tests) - Nav elements missing
9. **Parent Portal** (5 tests) - Parent-specific UI not rendering
10. **Payments E2E** (5 tests) - Payment modals/buttons missing
11. **Stripe Tests** (4 tests) - Stripe elements not rendering
12. **Auth Display** (1 test) - Dev accounts buttons not showing
13. **Login Flow** (2 tests) - Login redirect issues

## 🔧 Fixes Applied This Session

### Infrastructure
1. ✅ **PostgreSQL Session Store** - Sessions persist across deploys
2. ✅ **Session Auth in Redirects** - Dual auth support (Passport + session)
3. ✅ **Database Tables** - Correct schema with migrations
4. ✅ **Dev Login API** - Reliable authentication endpoint

### Test Framework
5. ✅ **API-Based Auth Setup** - Fast, reliable, no UI flakiness
6. ✅ **Increased Timeouts** - 30s for Render cold starts
7. ✅ **Exact Selectors** - Avoid strict mode violations
8. ✅ **Safe Array Handling** - Client pages handle various API responses

### Specific Test Fixes
9. ✅ **Announcements Button Text** - Corrected to "Create Announcement"
10. ✅ **Smoke Test Headings** - Use exact: true for uniqueness

---

## 🎯 Next Actions (For Whoever Continues)

### Immediate Quick Wins

**1. Check what's on the announcements page**
The smoke test passes (page loads), but the E2E test fails (can't click Create Announcement button). This suggests:
- Button exists but might be hidden/disabled
- Modal might not open properly
- Need to investigate with `--headed` mode

**2. Debug team page rendering**
The page route exists and component has the heading, but nothing renders. Check:
- Is there a Permission/role check hiding the page?
- Is an API call failing and showing error state?
- Is the layout component breaking?

**3. Settings tabs**
Check if tabs have proper ARIA roles and are visible.

### Systematic Investigation

Run this for each failing test:
```bash
BASE_URL=https://cricket-academy-app.onrender.com \
npx playwright test tests/announcements.e2e.spec.ts:15 --headed --debug
```

Check:
1. Does page load?
2. Does heading show?
3. Does button exist in DOM?
4. Is button visible (not `display: none`)?
5. Check browser console for errors
6. Check network tab for failed API calls

## 📈 Progress Tracking

| Session | Passing | Failing | Pass Rate | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Initial | 16 | 46 | 25.8% | Before fixes |
| Mid-session | 28 | 36 | 43.8% | Peak performance |
| Current | 22-27 | 36-42 | 34-42% | Variable due to Render cold starts |

**Trend:** Steady improvement with some volatility due to Render performance

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why Tests Are Flaky on Render
1. **Cold Starts** - Render spins down after inactivity, first request can take 30+ seconds
2. **Shared State** - Tests might be affecting each other (need better isolation)
3. **Network Latency** - Slower than localhost, need generous timeouts

### Why Pages Aren't Rendering
Hypothesis (needs investigation):
1. **Layout wrapper issues** - `DashboardLayout` might not be rendering children
2. **Permission checks** - Some pages might check role and hide content
3. **API failures** - Pages might be in error state if APIs return 500/404
4. **Missing data** - Some components might crash if required data is missing

## 🚀 Commands

### Run All Tests
```bash
BASE_URL=https://cricket-academy-app.onrender.com \
E2E_EMAIL=admin@test.com \
E2E_PASSWORD=password \
npx playwright test --reporter=line --workers=2
```

### Debug Single Test
```bash
BASE_URL=https://cricket-academy-app.onrender.com \
npx playwright test tests/announcements.e2e.spec.ts:15 --headed
```

### Check API Endpoints
```bash
# Login first
curl -c /tmp/c.txt -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@test.com"}' \
  https://cricket-academy-app.onrender.com/api/dev/login

# Test APIs
curl -b /tmp/c.txt https://cricket-academy-app.onrender.com/api/players
curl -b /tmp/c.txt https://cricket-academy-app.onrender.com/api/announcements/recent
```

*This is the current state after continuous fixing. Foundation is solid, remaining failures need individual investigation.*
